InfoViz Geek 
==========

Introduction
---------------
InfoVizGeek is a project which talks about the different tools and technologies which would enable an individual to create data visualizations. This repo has a vast list of tools along with their licensing available. This is an exhaustive list and I would be glad to accept additional tools which you guys out there in community use.

Visualization Classification
--------------------------------
According to my research and understanding till now, I would go ahead and set up a classification of all the visualizations. The visualizations can be broadly classified  as follows:-

 1. Charts
 2. Maps
 3. Time Series
 4. Flow
 5. Matrix
 6. Network
 7. Hierarchy
 8. Infographics
 9. Multiple
 10. Physical
