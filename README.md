InfoViz Geek 
==========

Introduction
---------------
InfoVizGeek is a project which talks about the different tools and technologies which would enable an individual to create data visualizations. This repo has a vast list of tools along with their licensing available. This is an exhaustive list and I would be glad to accept additional tools which you guys out there in community use.
